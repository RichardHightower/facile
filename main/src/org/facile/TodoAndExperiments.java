	//TODO # Move primitive filter, map and enumerate into separate module.
	//TODO # Create map primitive versions
	//TODO # Create reduce primitive versions
	//TODO # create a shift function like Perl's, look at Python pop, push. It should work with arrays and lists.
	//TODO # Add an ARGS holder for the main method. See if this is already a system property. 
	//TODO # Extract useful System properties into a class called System, which is system done right.
	//TODO # What if you create a file context like Perl's <IN>. This context could work with regex too like $1 (group 1 in split), $_ (line), @_ (array), next (regex), and unless (regex)
	//TODO # create len, _int, _float, _double, functions (rejected scalar, but scalar could be used for length of array, collection, and conversion of wrapper to primitive)
	//TODO # create len, _int, _float, _double, converters
	//TODO # the name enumerate kind of sucks... Perl, Groovy use forEach, Ruby uses each. I like enumerate the least.
	//TDOO # Change enumerate to each. It is shorter and more descriptive
	//TODO # Groovy uses find and findAll, we use filter like Python. We should create a find and findAll too.
	//TODO # A printIf command might be nice. Like print but does this Perlism print STDERR "$httperf_command\n" if $DEBUG; would look like printIf(DEBUG, STDERR, "blah blah");
	//TODO # Perl treats running a process like opening a file where the output of the process is a stream. I like this.
